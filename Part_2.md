# Hack School: Part 2 - Javascript/Node.js (10/22)

Workshop Recording: (__insert-link-here__)

In this workshop, we learned about Javascript and Node.js. Specifically, we learned about **variables**, **loops**, **arrow functions**, and **promises**.

We used these ideas to:
- [x] Create pokemon
- [x] Create attack functions
- [x] Determine how much damage each attack does

## What is JavaScript and NodeJS?

JavaScript is a scripting language (meaning: it has its own terminology, etc.). It is used to make applications [dynamic] and ***INTERACTIVE***.

Node.js is an environment that sits in between a server and the client-side (what you see). It allows an application to process JavaScript commands asynchronously [**(through asynchronous programming)**].

In Hack School, we will be using JavaScript and Node.js to make our Pokemon game move/change. JavaScript and Node.js handles every dialogue box, every change in HP, every user command, etc., and updates accordingly.


### Variables

Main Idea 1 is (explanation).

Some examples of Main Idea 1 are:

#### `(Code Command #1)`

`Code Command #1` is a (insert descriptor here). It takes (input) and (does output).

## Project Implementation

### Task 1

We want to do (insert task here) for our Pokemon generator.

For that, we use **main idea 1** and **main idea 2**.

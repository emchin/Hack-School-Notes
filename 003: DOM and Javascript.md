In the first part of this workshop, we learned about DOM and React. Specifically, we learned **how to access elements using JavaScript and DOM**, **the difference between React and HTML**, **components**, and **props**.

We used these ideas to to:
- [x] Pull starter code for this workshop
- [x] Write components in NavBar, TextBox and MemeGenerator
- [x] Change the style in NavBar
- [x] Add components to TextBox and LikeButton


## What is DOM?

DOM is the tree structure that organizes HTML elements. JavaScript uses the DOM organization to access HTML elements--like how you might use an address to find a location.

In Hack School, we will be using DOM to animate and modify the Pokemon Generator with JavaScript.

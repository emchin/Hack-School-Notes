## What is HTML/CSS?

HTML (Hyper-Text Markup Language) is a front-end language. It is used for structuring websites. If a website is like a house, then the HTML elements would be the foundations, walls, roof, etc.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) is another front-end language. It is used for styling websites. If a website is like a house, then the CSS elements would be the paint, decorations, color, etc that are applied to HTML elements.

In Hack School, we will be using HTML to create elements of the Pokemon Generator. We will be using CSS elements to style these HTML elements.

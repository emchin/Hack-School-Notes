# Unix/Git (10/8)

Workshop Recording: [here](__insert-link-here__)

Workshop Slides: [here](__insert-link-here__)

In this workshop, we learned about Unix and Git. Specifically, we completed our **Installations**, and then learned about **Unix**, and **mGit**.

We used these ideas to:
- [x] Install Git, Git Bash (for Windows), Node.js + npm
- [x] Learn how to navigate around files using Unix or Git Bash commands
- [x] Learn how to add, push/pull, and branch with Git
- [x] Create a branch of the Pokemon Generator using Git


## Installations:

### Git

For Mac users: (download instructions) (link)

For Windows: (download instructions) (link)

## Git Bash (for Windows users ONLY)

## What is Unix?

Unix is a computer operating system (OS). It allows you to move around your computer, select files, and execute commands.

Unix is the default OS on Mac computers. For Windows users, the default OS is Microsoft Windows OS, which is not as prevalent in tech industry. This is why Windows users will be using Git Bash, similar OS to Unix, which should have been downloaded in the previous step.

A programmer can access a computer's OS through the Command Line Interface (CLI) or the command line. This is where we enter commands.

In Hack School, we will be using Unix, through the command line, to access and modify files.
